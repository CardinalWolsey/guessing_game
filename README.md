Hi!  This is my guessing game.  The computer randomly generates a number between
one and one hundred and asks the user to input a number.  If the user guesses
too high or too low, the computer will allert the user of this and prompt
the user to guess again.  Once the user guesses the correct number, they get
a congradulatory(sp?) message, and the game ends.


Craig's "improvements":
Changed the while loop :)
Added a counter to count up to the maximum number of tries.
If max number is reached, you lose!

UPDATE
Changes:
  - Included constructors and functions
  - Kept the original game logic but replaced it with a Game contructor and a play function which are called at the end of the program
