    <h2>Guessing Game</h2>
    <p> This is my game </p>
    <h3> Instructions: First, guess a number between 1 and 100.  The computer will tell you if you guessed too high or too low.  You then will be prompted for another guess.  Keep guessing what you think the number is, but be careful.  You only have 7 guesses before the game ends!
    </h3>
